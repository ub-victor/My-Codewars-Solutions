const digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
// Create an iterator for the digits array
const arrayIterator = digits[Symbol.iterator]();

// The parentheses () after digits[Symbol.iterator] are used to call the iterator function. Here's a detailed explanation:

// In JavaScript, arrays have a built-in method called Symbol.iterator which returns an iterator object. This iterator object allows you to traverse the array one element at a time.

//Here's a breakdown of the code:

// digits is an array.
// digits[Symbol.iterator] accesses the iterator method of the array.
// digits[Symbol.iterator]()Symbol.iterator calls this method, which returns an iterator object.
// The iterator object has a next method that you can use to get the next value in the array. Each call to next returns an object with two properties: value (the next value in the array) and done (a boolean indicating whether the end of the array has been reached).

// Here's an example of how you might use the iterator:

// In summary, the parentheses () are used to call the Symbol.iterator method, which returns an iterator object for the digits array.
